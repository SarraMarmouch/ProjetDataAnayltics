🔳	The Most Nobel of Prizes
<p><FONT size="2pt" police="Verdana"><b><FONT color="gold">The Nobel Prize</FONT></b> is maybe the world's most well known scientific award. Except for the honor, prestige and substantial prize plutocrat the philanthropist also gets a gold order showing Alfred Nobel( 1833- 1896) who established the prize. Every time it's given to scientists and scholars in the orders chemistry, literature, drugs, physiology or drug, economics, and peace. 
The first Nobel Prize was handed out in 1901, and at that time the Prize was veritably Eurocentric and manly-focused, but currently it's not poisoned in any way whatsoever. <hr>
